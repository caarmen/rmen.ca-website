		<p>The following are a few projects I&#39;ve done in my spare
			time. &nbsp;The projects are presented by order of date, with the
			most recent ones first.</p>
		<h2>Nounours for Linux</h2>
		<h3>2012</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="nounours-linux.html"><img alt=""
				src="images/projects/screensaverconfig.png"
				style="margin-right: 25px; float: left; width: 399px; height: 300px;" /></a>
		</p>
		<p>The idea is based on the app I created for Android and iPhone
			(see below), but is rewritten in C for Linux (using the X11 API), and
			offers a standalone app as well as a screensaver (integrated with
			xscreensaver).</p>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>As with the Android app and Live Wallpapers, Nounours for
			Linux has several themes, including a theme featuring the Android
			robot.</div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
		<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
		<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
		<h2>Android applications</h2>
		<p>Since 2009, I have been interested in mobile development.
			&nbsp; I have developed a few applications for Android, and ported
			one of them to iPhone. &nbsp; I have only very briefly explored
			Blackberry, but would be interested in learning more about BlackBerry
			or Windows mobile development as well.&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>French Revolutionary Calendar Widget</h3>
		<h4>2011</h4>
		<p>
			<a

				style="margin-left: 25px; float: right; width: 150px; height: 250px;" /></a>
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
		<p>This is a widget which displays the current date and time in
			the French Revolutionary calendar. &nbsp; There are a couple of
			options: to show just the date or both the date and time, and to
			choose the method by which the date is calculated (the French
			revolutionaries never did agree on a method before they decided to
			return the Gregorian system).</p>
		<p>The scroll color changes each month.</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

		<h3>Offline GPS</h3>
		<h4>2010</h4>
		<p>This is a collection of Android applications which allow the
			user to find his location on a map without having an internet
			connection. &nbsp;I have created several versions of the application
			with various types of maps in the Paris area.</p>
		<p>At the time I created this Android application, I did not have
			a data/internet cell phone plan. &nbsp;I thought it both be useful to
			have a GPS, and interesting to see my location on historical maps.</p>
		<p>The different maps available are :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Paris 1760</li>
			<li>Paris 1832</li>
			<li>Paris 1898</li>
			<li>Paris OpenStreetMap</li>
			<li>Paris Pistes Cyclables (Bike routes)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>GeoFun!</h3>
		<h4>2010</h4>
		<p>
			<a
				href="https://market.android.com/details?id=ca.rmen.android.geofun"
				target="_blank"><img alt=""
				src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market/ca.rmen.android.geofun/hi-256-0-67dce098f0bdd1004aed9eb7ba3838243ec56646"
				style="margin-right: 15px; float: left; width: 128px; height: 128px;" /></a>
		</p>
		<p>This is a geography game for Android which presents a map to
			the user, and a location to identify. &nbsp;The user has 90 seconds
			to identify as many locations as possible. &nbsp;The user&#39;s score
			is based on the response time as well as accuracy. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>Several maps are available, such as the world, each of the
			continents, France, and some specific information maps such as
			dialing codes of countries.</p>
		<p>The user may choose from several levels of difficulty, from
			Easy (the city and country are both provided) to Extreme (the user
			must enter the longitude and latitude coordinates manually instead of
			touching the map).</p>
		<p>
			<i>Implementation detail</i>: &nbsp;The main logic for the game was
			implemented initially in Java Swing. &nbsp;I then packaged the pure
			Java code (any code not specifically related to Swing) into a library
			and extended it for the Android app.
		</p>
		<h3>Noonoors</h3>
		<h4>2009-2010</h4>
		<p>
			<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=ca.rmen.nounours"
				target="_blank"><img alt=""
				src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market/ca.rmen.nounours/hi-256-0-d0ce17c7afa9ce995d90756a0e28c9fcdd8d4323"
				style="margin-right: 25px; float: left; width: 128px; height: 128px;" /></a>
		</p>
		<p>AKA &quot;Nounours&quot;, this is an Android application
			featuring a teddy bear. &nbsp;I took about 30 photographs of the bear
			from different angles, and used these photos to create a model of the
			bear. &nbsp;This application served as a learning project for me, to
			become familiar with various features of Android. &nbsp;The
			application has the following functionalities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Move the teddy bear by dragging his paws, stomach, nose, or
				ears.</li>
			<li>Make the bear do some animations with fling gestures.</li>
			<li>Shake the phone to make the bear shake.</li>
			<li>Tilt the phone to make the bear look in the direction of the
				phone.</li>
			<li>Choose an animation to run from a list of animations
				(flying, dancing, etc)</li>
			<li>Change the theme: the background and clothes the bear wears
				change. &nbsp;There is also a theme with the Android robot.</li>
			<li>After a brief idle time, the bear moves by himself.
				&nbsp;After a longer idle time, he goes to sleep.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The app exists as a standard app which has multiple themes, as
			well as multiple Live Wallpaper apps (each with one theme).</p>
		<p>I have ported Noonoors to the iPhone, but I have not yet placed
			it on the App Store or on Cydia. &nbsp; As of today, the iPhone
			version exists only on my phone :)</p>
		<h4>Windows Screensaver:</h4>
		<p>
			As with GeoFun!, I initially developed Noonoors in Java Swing, and
			packaging it into a library, was able to separate the
			Android-specific code from the application logic. &nbsp;This allowed
			me to easily port the application as a <a
				href="http://lubek.b.free.fr/nounours/screensaver/nounours-win32-20100602.zip">screensaver</a>&nbsp;for
			Windows.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Just for fun</h2>
		<p>Here are a couple of programs I did eons ago :)&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Snake</h3>
		<h4>2001</h4>
		<p>I spent a few weekends in 2001 developing this snake game.
			&nbsp;At the time it was developed on Linux, using QT for the
			graphics. &nbsp;I recently updated it to work on MacOS, with the
			latest version of QT.</p>
		<p>
			You can download the <a href="files/snake-20110625.zip">source
				code here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>

				style="width: 400px; height: 422px;" />
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>BlackJack</h3>
		<h4>1996</h4>
		<p>I would consider this my first program useful or entertaining
			enough to share :) &nbsp;At the time I wrote this, I was not yet a
			computer science student, but I was taking one course in C
			programming. &nbsp;The program was written in C, on VMS. &nbsp;It
			required no modifications to get it to compile and run on Mac OS X
			fifteen years later.</p>
		<p>
			You can download the <a href="files/blackjack.c"
				target="_blank">source code here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Part of the logic for shuffling the cards came from the textbook in
			the C class I was taking, I believe&nbsp;<a
				href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5Hw_AQAAIAAJ" target="_blank">&quot;C:
				how to program&quot; by Deitel &amp; Deitel, 1994</a>.
