			<p>The following are a few projects I&#39;ve done in my spare
				time. &nbsp;The projects are presented by order of date, with the
				most recent ones first.</p>
			<h2>Nounours for Linux</h2>
			<h3>2012</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="nounours-linux.html"><img alt="" src="images/projects/screensaverconfig.png" style="margin-right: 25px; float: left; width: 399px; height: 300px;" /></a>
			</p>
			<p>The idea is based on the app I created for Android and iPhone
				(see below), but is rewritten in C for Linux (using the X11 API), and
				offers a standalone app as well as a screensaver (integrated with
				xscreensaver).</p>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>As with the Android app and Live Wallpapers, Nounours for
				Linux has several themes, including a theme featuring the Android
				robot.</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
			<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
			<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
			<h2>Android applications</h2>
			<p>Since 2009, I have been interested in mobile development.
				&nbsp; I have developed a few applications for Android, and ported
				one of them to iPhone. &nbsp; I have only very briefly explored
				Blackberry, but would be interested in learning more about BlackBerry
				or Windows mobile development as well.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>French Revolutionary Calendar Widget</h3>
			<h4>2011</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.rmen.android.frenchcalendar"><img alt=""

						style="margin-left: 25px; float: right; width: 150px; height: 250px;" /></a>
			</p>
			<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>This is a widget which displays the current date and time in
				the French Revolutionary calendar. &nbsp; There are a couple of
				options: to show just the date or both the date and time, and to
				choose the method by which the date is calculated (the French
				revolutionaries never did agree on a method before they decided to
				return the Gregorian system).</p>
			<p>The scroll color changes each month.</p>
			<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

			<h3>Offline GPS</h3>
			<h4>2010</h4>
			<p>This is a collection of Android applications which allow the
				user to find his location on a map without having an internet
				connection. &nbsp;I have created several versions of the application
				with various types of maps in the Paris area.</p>
			<p>At the time I created this Android application, I did not have
				a data/internet cell phone plan. &nbsp;I thought it both be useful to
				have a GPS, and interesting to see my location on historical maps.</p>
			<p>The different maps available are :</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Paris 1760</li>
				<li>Paris 1832</li>
				<li>Paris 1898</li>
				<li>Paris OpenStreetMap</li>
				<li>Paris Pistes Cyclables (Bike routes)</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>GeoFun!</h3>
			<h4>2010</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=ca.rmen.android.geofun" target="_blank"><img alt=""
						src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market/ca.rmen.android.geofun/hi-256-0-67dce098f0bdd1004aed9eb7ba3838243ec56646"
						style="margin-right: 15px; float: left; width: 128px; height: 128px;" /></a>
			</p>
			<p>This is a geography game for Android which presents a map to
				the user, and a location to identify. &nbsp;The user has 90 seconds
				to identify as many locations as possible. &nbsp;The user&#39;s score
				is based on the response time as well as accuracy. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Several maps are available, such as the world, each of the
				continents, France, and some specific information maps such as
				dialing codes of countries.</p>
			<p>The user may choose from several levels of difficulty, from
				Easy (the city and country are both provided) to Extreme (the user
				must enter the longitude and latitude coordinates manually instead of
				touching the map).</p>
			<p>
				<i>Implementation detail</i>: &nbsp;The main logic for the game was
				implemented initially in Java Swing. &nbsp;I then packaged the pure
				Java code (any code not specifically related to Swing) into a library
				and extended it for the Android app.
			</p>
			<h3>Noonoors</h3>
			<h4>2009-2010</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=ca.rmen.nounours" target="_blank"><img alt=""
						src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market/ca.rmen.nounours/hi-256-0-d0ce17c7afa9ce995d90756a0e28c9fcdd8d4323"
						style="margin-right: 25px; float: left; width: 128px; height: 128px;" /></a>
			</p>
			<p>AKA &quot;Nounours&quot;, this is an Android application
				featuring a teddy bear. &nbsp;I took about 30 photographs of the bear
				from different angles, and used these photos to create a model of the
				bear. &nbsp;This application served as a learning project for me, to
				become familiar with various features of Android. &nbsp;The
				application has the following functionalities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Move the teddy bear by dragging his paws, stomach, nose, or
					ears.</li>
				<li>Make the bear do some animations with fling gestures.</li>
				<li>Shake the phone to make the bear shake.</li>
				<li>Tilt the phone to make the bear look in the direction of the
					phone.</li>
				<li>Choose an animation to run from a list of animations
					(flying, dancing, etc)</li>
				<li>Change the theme: the background and clothes the bear wears
					change. &nbsp;There is also a theme with the Android robot.</li>
				<li>After a brief idle time, the bear moves by himself.
					&nbsp;After a longer idle time, he goes to sleep.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The app exists as a standard app which has multiple themes, as
				well as multiple Live Wallpaper apps (each with one theme).</p>
			<p>I have ported Noonoors to the iPhone, but I have not yet placed
				it on the App Store or on Cydia. &nbsp; As of today, the iPhone
				version exists only on my phone :)</p>
			<h4>Windows Screensaver:</h4>
			<p>
				As with GeoFun!, I initially developed Noonoors in Java Swing, and
				packaging it into a library, was able to separate the
				Android-specific code from the application logic. &nbsp;This allowed
				me to easily port the application as a <a href="http://lubek.b.free.fr/nounours/screensaver/nounours-win32-20100602.zip">screensaver</a>&nbsp;for
				Windows.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>Just for fun</h2>
			<p>Here are a couple of programs I did eons ago :)&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Snake</h3>
			<h4>2001</h4>
			<p>I spent a few weekends in 2001 developing this snake game.
				&nbsp;At the time it was developed on Linux, using QT for the
				graphics. &nbsp;I recently updated it to work on MacOS, with the
				latest version of QT.</p>
			<p>
				You can download the <a href="files/snake-20110625.zip">source
					code here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img alt="" src="images/projects/snake.png" style="width: 400px; height: 422px;" />
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>BlackJack</h3>
			<h4>1996</h4>
			<p>I would consider this my first program useful or entertaining
				enough to share :) &nbsp;At the time I wrote this, I was not yet a
				computer science student, but I was taking one course in C
				programming. &nbsp;The program was written in C, on VMS. &nbsp;It
				required no modifications to get it to compile and run on Mac OS X
				fifteen years later.</p>
			<p>
				You can download the <a href="files/blackjack.c" target="_blank">source code here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of the logic for shuffling the cards came from the textbook in
				the C class I was taking, I believe&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5Hw_AQAAIAAJ" target="_blank">&quot;C:
					how to program&quot; by Deitel &amp; Deitel, 1994</a>.
